# ft_server 
This is my 5th project of 1337 school (42 reseau)

This topic is intended to introduce you to system administration. It will make you aware
of the importance of using scripts to automate your tasks. For that, you will discover
the "docker" technology and use it to install a complete web server. This server will run
multiples services: Wordpress, phpMyAdmin, and a SQL database.

Ps - I use a lot of documentation I hope that It will help you to understand my code .
